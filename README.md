# AES256_Encryption
AES256 Implementation with Sequential and Parallel classes in Java lang.
* EncryptAES256.java file solves the problem with sequential method.
* EncJavaParallel.java file encrypt data with highest possible thread number using Parallel Team and Parallel Region libraries.
* EncJavaParallel2.java file encrypt same way with EncJavaParallel.java but there is thread number options either. You can use as much as thread you want.
* EncJavaThread.java file encrypt data parallely, but with Java Thread. The difference between this one and other parallel solutions is we have to handle syncronization by ourself in this method.
